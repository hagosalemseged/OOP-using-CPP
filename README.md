#### Object Oriented programming using C++

* OOP means creating objects that contains both data and functions.
* Class is a template for creating objects and object is an instace of class.
* Attributes and methods are basically variables and functions that belongs to class. these are often refered to as "class memebers".
* Class is user defined data type or blueprint for creating objects.

###### C++ class methods

* [X] methods are functions that are belongs to class.
* [X] there are two ways to define function that belongs to a class( Inside and outside class defintions).

###### Constructor

* [X] Is a special method that is automatically called when an object of class is created.
* [X] It has the same name as class name.
* [X] It does not have return type.

###### Access Specifiers

1. Public => members are accessible from outside of class.
2. Private => members are not accessible from outside of class.
3. Protected => members are not accessible from outside of class but they are accessible in inherited class.

###### Encapsulation

* [X] It is the process of bundling date and function members that operate together inside single class.
* [X] Used to make sure that sensitive data is hidden from users. To achieve this you must declare variables as private access specifier.
* [X] If you want to read or modify the value of a private members, you can provide public get and set methods.

###### Inheritance

* [X] It is possible to inherit attributes and methods from one class to another class.
* [X] we can group inheritance in to two:
* [X] Derived(child) class => the class that inherits from another class
* [X] Base(parent) class => the class being inehrited from.

###### Polymoriphism

* [X] Polymoriphism means many forms and it occurs we have many classes that are related to each other by inheritance.

###### Abstraction

* [X] refer to providing only essential information to the outside world and hiding thier background details.
* [X] Abstraction can be achieved by two ways: 1. abstract class 2. interface
